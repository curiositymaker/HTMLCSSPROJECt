                        These are the unsophisticated questions an intelligent child might ask; and Feynman as a child
                        asked precisely such questions. A ball lying in his little red wagon would roll to the back when
                        he pulled the wagon forward, and it would roll to the front when the wagon stopped. The little
                        boy wanted to know why this happened. His father, a uniform salesman, who according to family
                        lore said that if his first child were a boy he would be a scientist, explained to his son what
                        inertia is, but added that nobody knows why it works as it does.
